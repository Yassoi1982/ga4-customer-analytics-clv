# Segment Definitions

## RFM segments (rule-based)
- Champions: very recent, frequent, high revenue users
- Loyal: recent and frequent users with strong value
- Potential Loyalist: decent recency + frequency; nurture to convert
- New Customers: very recent but low frequency; onboarding needed
- At Risk: older recency but historically frequent; win-back campaigns
- Hibernating: old + low frequency/value; low priority or reactivation tests
- Needs Attention: middle group; targeted offers based on channel/device

## K-means clusters (data-driven)
After running `kmeans_cluster_profile.sql`, describe each cluster using:
- Average revenue / purchases / sessions
- Recency and tenure patterns
- Suggested marketing action
